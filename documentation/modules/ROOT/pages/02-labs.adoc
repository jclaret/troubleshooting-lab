== Introduction

This section presents a comprehensive collection of hands-on troubleshooting scenarios designed to enhance your OpenShift expertise. These exercises simulate real-world challenges that OpenShift administrators and platform engineers encounter in production environments.

The troubleshooting exercises are organized into the following specialized areas:

* *OpenShift Resources and Tools*: Essential commands and diagnostic utilities
* *OpenShift Monitoring*: Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting troubleshooting
* *OpenShift Telco RAN Reference Design*: 5G telecommunications-specific configurations
* *OpenShift Deployments - ZTP Workflow*: Zero Touch Provisioning and ACM troubleshooting
* *GitOps Operator - Sync Flows*: ArgoCD and application synchronization issues
* *Node Tuning Operator - Performance Profiles*: Performance Profiles troubleshooting
* *RHCOS Image Layering*: Applying hotfixes and custom configurations
* *Storage - OpenShift Data Foundation*: Persistent volume and Ceph troubleshooting
* *OpenShift Security*: Security Context Constraints and application permissions
* *OpenShift Control Plane - ETCD*: Etcd cluster troubleshooting

== Troubleshooting Strategy: Using the Scientific Method

Effective troubleshooting requires a systematic approach that eliminates guesswork and ensures reproducible results. Throughout these labs, we'll apply a structured methodology based on the scientific method adapted for IT troubleshooting scenarios.

=== Troubleshooting Process

==== 1. Information Gathering
*Objective*: Collect comprehensive data about the problem environment

* Gather symptoms and error messages from multiple sources
* Document system configurations and recent changes  
* Identify affected components and their relationships
* Establish timeline of events leading to the issue
* Collect relevant logs, metrics, and diagnostic outputs

==== 2. Problem Definition
*Objective*: Create a precise and measurable problem statement

* Define what is working versus what is not working
* Establish clear success criteria for resolution
* Identify the scope and impact of the issue
* Document expected behavior versus observed behavior
* Determine if this is a new problem or recurring issue

==== 3. Hypothesis Development
*Objective*: Formulate logical theories based on collected evidence

* Analyze gathered data to identify potential root causes
* Prioritize hypotheses based on likelihood and impact
* Consider multiple possible explanations for observed symptoms
* Reference known issues and common failure patterns
* Ensure hypotheses are testable and measurable

==== 4. Hypothesis Testing
*Objective*: Systematically validate or eliminate each theory

* Design specific tests to prove or disprove each hypothesis
* Execute tests in a controlled manner to avoid additional issues
* Use non-disruptive diagnostic commands when possible
* Test one variable at a time to isolate cause and effect
* Document test procedures for reproducibility

==== 5. Analysis and Documentation
*Objective*: Evaluate test results and refine understanding

* Record all test outcomes, both positive and negative results
* Analyze patterns and correlations in the data
* Refine hypotheses based on new evidence
* Document lessons learned and knowledge gained
* Maintain detailed troubleshooting logs for future reference

==== 6. Solution Implementation and Verification
*Objective*: Apply fixes and confirm complete resolution

* Implement the most appropriate solution based on analysis
* Apply changes incrementally and monitor impact
* Verify that the original problem is completely resolved
* Confirm that the fix doesn't introduce new issues
* Document the final solution and prevention measures

=== Benefits of This Approach

* *Reduces Resolution Time*: Systematic approach prevents unnecessary trial-and-error
* *Improves Accuracy*: Evidence-based decisions lead to correct solutions
* *Builds Knowledge*: Documented process creates reusable troubleshooting procedures
* *Minimizes Risk*: Controlled testing prevents additional system disruption
* *Enhances Skills*: Methodical practice develops expert-level troubleshooting abilities
