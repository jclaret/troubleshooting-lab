== Introduction

This section presents a comprehensive collection of hands-on troubleshooting scenarios designed to enhance your OpenShift expertise. These exercises simulate real-world challenges that OpenShift administrators and platform engineers encounter in production environments.

The troubleshooting exercises are organized into the following specialized areas:

* *OpenShift Resources and Tools*: Essential commands and diagnostic utilities
* *OpenShift Telco RAN Reference Design*: RDS configurations
* *OpenShift Deployments - ZTP Workflow*: Zero Touch Provisioning and ACM troubleshooting
* *GitOps Operator - Sync Flows*: ArgoCD and application synchronization issues
* *Node Tuning Operator - Performance Profiles*: Performance Profiles troubleshooting
* *RHCOS Image Layering*: Applying hotfixes and custom configurations
* *Storage - OpenShift Data Foundation*: Persistent volume and Ceph troubleshooting
* *OpenShift Security*: Security Context Constraints and application permissions
* *OpenShift Control Plane - ETCD*: Etcd cluster troubleshooting

== Troubleshooting Strategy: Using the Scientific Method

For effective troubleshooting, we recommend following a structured approach that helps you work smarter, not harder. This methodology will guide you through complex problems systematically, reducing guesswork and improving your success rate. In this lab, we'll explore these key troubleshooting principles:

=== Troubleshooting Methodology

==== 1. Information Gathering
**What to do:** Get all the facts before jumping into fixes

- Collect error messages and symptoms from different sources
- Check what changed recently in the system
- Map out which parts are affected and how they connect
- Build a timeline of when things started going wrong
- Gather logs and monitoring data from relevant components

==== 2. Problem Definition
**What to do:** Be clear about what you're trying to fix

- Identify exactly what's broken vs. what's still working
- Set specific goals for what "fixed" means
- Understand how big the impact is and who's affected
- Compare what should happen vs. what's actually happening
- Determine if this is a new issue or something that's happened before

==== 3. Hypothesis Development
**What to do:** Use the evidence to build logical explanations

- Look at your data and brainstorm possible causes
- Focus on the most likely culprits first
- Consider multiple explanations - don't tunnel vision on one idea
- Think about common problems you've seen before
- Make sure your theories can actually be tested

==== 4. Hypothesis Testing
**What to do:** Prove or disprove your theories systematically

- Design specific tests for each theory
- Use safe, non-disruptive commands when possible
- Test one thing at a time to see what really causes what
- Change only what you need to for each test
- Keep track of what you tried and what happened

==== 5. Analysis and Documentation
**What to do:** Make sense of your results and adjust course

- Record everything - successes and failures both matter
- Look for patterns in what you're seeing
- Update your theories based on new information
- Document what you learned for next time
- Keep detailed notes of your troubleshooting journey

==== 6. Solution Implementation and Verification
**What to do:** Implement the solution and make sure it works

- Apply the fix that makes the most sense based on your analysis
- Make changes gradually and watch the impact
- Confirm the original problem is completely gone
- Check that your fix didn't break anything else
- Document the solution and how to prevent it in the future

=== Benefits of This Approach

- **Saves Time:** No more random guessing - you work with purpose
- **Gets Results:** Evidence-based decisions lead to the right answers
- **Builds Expertise:** Each problem teaches you something for the next one
- **Reduces Risk:** Controlled testing means fewer "oops" moments
- **Improves Confidence:** A clear process helps you tackle any problem
