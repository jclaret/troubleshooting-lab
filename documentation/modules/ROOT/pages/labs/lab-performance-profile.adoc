== Understanding Performance Profiles

=== Performance Profile Components

Performance Profiles are a high-level abstraction that configures OpenShift nodes for latency-sensitive workloads. Key components include:

* **CPU Management**: Isolated vs reserved CPU cores for application and system workloads
* **Huge Pages**: Large memory pages to reduce TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) misses
* **Real-time Kernel**: Optional real-time kernel for deterministic latency
* **NUMA Topology**: Non-Uniform Memory Access configuration for memory locality
* **Kernel Parameters**: Low-level system tuning for performance optimization

=== Performance Profile Troubleshooting commands

After applying a Performance Profile, verify its status with the following commands:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Check Performance Profile status
oc get performanceprofile
oc get performanceprofile -o yaml
oc get performanceprofiles.performance.openshift.io -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Degraded")]}' | jq 'select(.status=="True")'

# Verify generated Tuned profiles
oc get profiles.tuned.openshift.io -A
oc get profiles.tuned.openshift.io -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator

# Check related MachineConfig and MachineConfigPool status
oc get mc,mcp,nodes -o wide

# Verify huge pages configuration on nodes
oc debug node/<node-name> -- chroot /host cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i huge
oc debug node/<node-name> -- chroot /host cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
----

== Exercise 1: Troubleshooting Huge Pages Application

=== Scenario Setup

You need to deploy an application that requires huge pages for optimal performance. The application has been configured to request huge pages resources, but there seems to be an issue with the deployment.

Navigate to the lab scenario:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Change to the performance profile lab directory
cd troubleshooting-lab/lab-materials/02-performance-profile/lab1-hugepages
----

=== Deploying the Application

Deploy the application and the Performance Profile configuration:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Deploy the huge pages application
oc new-project hugepages-web
oc apply -f hugepages-web.yaml

# Apply the Performance Profile configuration
oc apply -f performance_profile.yaml

# Check application status
oc get pods -n hugepages-web
----

=== Investigation Challenge

The application is not starting as expected. Use the troubleshooting commands provided at the beginning of this lab to investigate the issue.

**Your task**: Identify why the application is not running and resolve the problem.

**Time limit**: 15-20 minutes of investigation before checking the solution.

[TIP]
====
ðŸ’¡ **Investigation approach**: 

Start by examining the application status and then investigate the Performance Profile configuration. Use the commands from the "Performance Profile Troubleshooting commands" section above.

Key areas to investigate:

- Application pod status and events
- Performance Profile status and conditions
- Node labels and Machine Config Pool configuration
- Huge pages availability on nodes

If you've completed your investigation, here's the solution:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Update the Performance Profile to use the workshop MCP
oc replace -f solution/performance_profile.yaml

# Wait for Performance Profile to be applied
oc get performanceprofile lab1-hugepages -o yaml

# Monitor MachineConfigPool rollout
oc get mcp workshop -w
----
====

=== Verification

Verify that the huge pages application now starts successfully:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Verify application is now running
oc get pods -n hugepages-web
oc rollout status deployment/hugepages-web -n hugepages-web

# Access the application to verify huge pages configuration
oc get route hugepages-web -n hugepages-web -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
# curl http://<route-url> or open in browser

== Exercise 2: Troubleshooting Kernel Parameter Tuning

=== Problem Definition: Application Requiring Custom Kernel Parameters

Navigate to the second lab scenario:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Change to the second performance profile lab directory
cd troubleshooting-lab/lab-materials/02-performance-profile/lab2-tuned

# Review the provided files
ls -la

# Expected files:
- conntrack-app.yaml (Application requiring custom kernel.pid_max)
- machine_config_pool.yaml (New machine config pool)
- performance_profile.yaml (New Performace Profile)
- tuned.yaml (Tuned profile)
----

=== Deploying the Second application

Deploy the application that requires custom kernel parameters:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Scale up 1 additional node using the machineset name
MACHINESET=$(oc get machinesets.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api -o name | head -1)
echo "Using machineset: $MACHINESET"
oc scale $MACHINESET -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=6

# Verify the new machine is being created
oc get machines.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
oc get nodes

# Label a worker node for the new MCP
NODE=$(oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')
echo "Selected node: $NODE"

# Remove worker label and add new-mcp label
oc label node "$NODE" node-role.kubernetes.io/mcp-conntrack="" --overwrite

# Verify node labeling
oc get node "$NODE" --show-labels | grep mcp-conntrack

# Create a new Machine Config Pool and update Performance Profile
oc apply -f machine_config_pool.yaml
oc apply -f performance_profile.yaml
oc apply -f tuned.yaml

# Monitor MachineConfigPool rollout
oc get mcp mcp-conntrack
oc get nodes

# Wait for Performance Profile to be applied
oc get performanceprofile lab2-conntrack

# Deploy the conntrack application
oc new-project conntrack-app
oc apply -f conntrack-app.yaml

# Check application status
oc get pods -n conntrack-app
oc describe pod -n conntrack-app
oc logs deployment/conntrack-app -n conntrack-app
----

The application will fail with an error indicating incorrect `conntrack` value.

=== Investigation Challenge

Spend time investigating the Tuned profile degradation:

1. **Why is the Tuned profile showing as DEGRADED?**
2. **What syntax errors exist in the Tuned configuration?**
3. **How do custom Tuned profiles inherit from Performance Profile base configurations?**

[TIP]
====
ðŸ’¡ **Hint**: Look for invalid parameter values or syntax errors in the Tuned profile. The profile should inherit from the Performance Profile base configuration and override specific parameters.

Check the events and conditions in the Tuned profile status.
====

=== Solution Implementation

[%collapsible]
====
Apply the corrected Tuned profile:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Remove the broken Tuned profile
oc solution
oc apply -f tuned.yaml

# Monitor profile application
oc get profiles.tuned.openshift.io -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator

# Wait for profile to show as APPLIED=True, DEGRADED=False
oc get profile <node-profile-name> -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator -w
----
====

=== Verification

Verify that the kernel parameter is correctly applied:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# Check updated kernel.pid_max value
oc debug node/$NODE -- chroot /host sysctl kernel.pid_max

# Restart the application to pick up new kernel parameters
oc rollout restart deployment/conntrack-app -n conntrack-app
oc rollout status deployment/conntrack-app -n conntrack-app

# Verify application now starts successfully
oc get pods -n conntrack-app
oc logs deployment/conntrack-app -n conntrack-app

# Test application functionality
oc get route conntrack-app -n conntrack-app -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
# curl http://<route-url> should return success
----
